# Hit-Song-Prediction

## Purpose

This project served as my introduction to machine learning, focusing specifically on logistic regression. Alongside programming this project with a group of contributors, I learned the fundamentals of machine learning, such as the different ML algorithms, how data is split into training and testing sets, and the fundamental mathematics involved.

Implementing my own sigmoid function, loss function, and gradient descent was beyond the scope of this initial project. However, gaining an understanding of these underlying mathematical concepts was immensely insightful.
